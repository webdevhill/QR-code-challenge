## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- media-queries

### What I learned

 Positioning and proportioning elements in CSS from a .jpeg can be a bit tricky. A fellow member on Front-end Mentor pointed out that I was using width instead of max-width. That was killing my responsiveness in flexbox. Ty @vcarames. The responsiveness seems decent Hopefully my proportions are closer this time.

### Continued development

revisit flexbox and mobile first RWD, CSS grid
