## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had more difficulty positioning thess items with flexbox and media queries than I expected. Viewing it with Chrome dev tools and manually adjusting the width to see break points is entirely different than using the dev tool's "Device Mode".The top margin and proportions are what was giving me problems. 

### Continued development

revisit flexbox and mobile first RWD, the Device Mode in Chrome dev tools is so different then manually inspecting breakpoints
